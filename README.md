# randomProject
Random Project is a multi disciplinary project that will generate random numbers. In this repository I'll attempt to give a detailed description and explanation of my journey.

I'll eventually create an organized documentation as I go along

here is my dumping ground:<br>
quick notes:
write some words on the reason I started this project, the research I did, document the tools and hardware, document the code

ha a geiger counter 5v-ot ad, akkot nem szabad hasznalnom a normal gpio pin-eket
